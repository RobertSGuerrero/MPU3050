The project developed an interactive solution that combines real-time data from the MPU6050 sensor with a 3D graphical representation on a web page. Using an accelerometer and gyroscope built into the MPU6050, motion data was captured and processed and transmitted via the NRF24L01 module to a Raspberry Pi Pico W. The data was packaged in binary to optimize space and maintain accuracy, while the Applying moving average and threshold filters reduced noise and improved the quality of the readings. Finally, the data was processed on the server and displayed on a web page with interactive animation, using Three.js to represent a 3D cube that responds to the movement of the sensor. The result is an efficient, responsive and versatile system that demonstrates the operation of the sensor and its ability to monitor and represent movements in real time.
